# Kazakh Story Generator

Story generator in "pure" kazakh language

## Final aim: generate random stories based on the uploaded photo

### Technical TODO List

	1. Go to TensorFlow and install it
	2. Do basic tutorial
	3. Read more on NLP (more practical). More related to the NLG
	4. Make very simple parody with very small "english" data
	5. Think beforehand about the scale (total words (combinations) in kazakh, which dataset to use (probably wikipedia and some poems), storage capacity needed, complexity of chosen algorithm based on that, how many machines will I need, how many users will be, QPS )
	6. Replicate the process for kazakh language
	7. Add more data and see how "random stories" generated
	8. Think of the metric needed to measure the "creativity" and "quality" of stories produced. That is needed to find appropriate threshold. In other words when I will be sure that I have enough big dataset and not too big.
	9. Get big data (e.g. wikipedia)
	10. Replicate the process (on given machines)
	11. Test a lot


	12. Read more about understanding photo
	13. Think about basic heuristic to use extracted information from image to generate a random story
	
	14. Test everything
	15. Fit everything in N machines and M databases
	
	16. Synchronize with Arman (with the frontend)


### Marketing TODO List

	1. Start to getting more users to send invitations during release
	2. Talk with media sources to publish this thing
	3. Release MVP to see what people need
